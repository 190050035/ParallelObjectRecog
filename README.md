# Parallel Object Recognition using Ray

Parallel Object Recognition using ray which is used in recognising ojects in parallel and series with the help of SSD algorithm with OpenCV and RayFramework by using coco as dataset.


**Data set:**
The COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset in the field of computer vision, specifically for tasks related to object detection, segmentation, and captioning. The dataset is designed to address the complexities of real-world scenes, offering a diverse and challenging collection of images.
COCO contains images collected from a wide range of sources, encompassing various scenes, objects, and scenarios. This diversity makes it suitable for training models that need to generalize well to different real-world conditions.



SSD Algorithm: Single Shot Detector (SSD) is a deep learning-based object detection algorithm. It efficiently performs object detection in a single forward pass of a neural network, providing a balance between speed and accuracy. SSD is particularly effective for real-time applications due to its ability to handle multiple object scales in an image simultaneously.

OpenCV: OpenCV (Open-Source Computer Vision Library) is a comprehensive open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. It provides a wide range of tools and functions for image and video processing, including features like image manipulation, object detection, and machine learning support. OpenCV is widely used in both academia and industry for computer vision applications.

Ray Framework: Ray is a distributed computing framework for Python that enables parallel and distributed processing. It allows developers to easily scale their Python applications across multiple cores or even cluster environments. Ray is particularly useful for handling complex and computationally intensive tasks in a parallelized manner, improving overall processing efficiency.
